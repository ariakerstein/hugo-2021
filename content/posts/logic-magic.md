Today I reviewed my year. I stared at the sheet of paper - a ledger weighing the good and the bad. Then, a question: how many sublime moments did I have? 
I added a third column, straight down the the middle of the sheet, labeled: sublime moments. 

My first observation was there were not as many as I'd have thought. Second, they were not so much orchestrated as they were enabled by removing blockers. Third, the blocker for me is distraction and worry. In my mind there tends to be a steady state of agitation or background hum, processing all the things. 

So these moments were the product of letting go. Seems the great paradox of our times that we do so much when we actually need so little. Fourth, I'm nearly always in nature.  

There was the time I went Cross-country skiing with Lev. The time I sat in the back yard sitting on the bench and staring at the trees. And the time Lua was inconsolable...

I tried to wait it out. She wouldn't stop. I scooped her out of her crib. Shhh, I said, wiping her sweaty hair from her face. She quieted down as I carried her, tiny torso against my chest. I brought her into my bedroom. There is a lemon tree by the window. We looked at it a moment. I pointed to the lemons. Do you see them, I asked? A soft but scratchy voice responded. Yes, daddy. Lemons. What's that? I asked, pointing to the moon. Lua, she said (it means moon in Portuguese).
Her face beamed in the light. I saw a version of myself.Â The world was for a few precious moments quiet. I held my daughter. 

The lemons created interesting negative space, to the night sky Logic is good, it's where most of us spend our days. But let's not forget the magic.
