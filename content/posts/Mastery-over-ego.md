Mastery over ego

Internal interest and direction came from somewhere. If you trace it back ask youself if this came from others or from yourself.

Power is a barrier. When you have a manager, a team, it’s easy for a switch to happen. In my own career I’ve seen the worst in my emerge when I switch from a mastery mindset to an ego mindset. I start worrying about optics, shielding, upward communication. This is what’s called taking your eye off the ball. And it’s been a personal barrier to doing the work.

Michael Jordan said it's about the fans. The tactics he used to get inside other players heads was in service of greatness and mastery. Jeff Bezos says it’s about customers.

The problem is when customers are secondary - abstract or distant. Then the company perimeter/arena dominates.

How can we return to a mastery mindset amidst pressures of reviews and the practical prssures of corporate life?

The inner game of tennis talks about challenge as a mechanic for understanding.
