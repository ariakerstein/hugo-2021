> If you emphasize the physical side of training you may become superbly conditioned but mentally not advanced at all. On the other hand, if you concentrate on the mental aspect, it is inevitable that the physical side will follow. My golden rule is to train for the mental toughness and not to train for the physical development. 
> - Herb Elliott (world champion middle distance runner)
The past several months have been insane. I left the small San Francisco startup I was working at when we didn't get our funding round. I spent nearly 3 months networking, studying and wondering what to do next. I won't forget this time, it's been wonderful to network with some of the most talented folks in the valley, advise several startups, study some topics I've been interested in for a long time - and yes - wake up several mornings with a feeling of dread that I have no income.  

This race comes at about day 30 of the new role. So my training has been short. 

I’m proud of the race I ran given my lack of training. This wasn’t any spectacular time or records broken. But I toughed this one out in a way that was a bit different than hitting a marathon time. The half marathon is really different from the marathon in that your strength isn’t totally gone by the end of the race. There are reserves to draw upon that can be fueled by adrenaline. 

There were 4 keys to success today that I'll outline below. 
1. **Preparation - making the most of a little:**
	I've taken to running with a headlamp up twin peaks late at night for purely logistical reasons. Turns out this is one of the most magical runs in the city. Sutro tower at night swept by fog and backlit by stars has this other-worldly beautiful quality. While only 4 miles round-trip, I suspect that from a power (watts) output perspective it's actually equivalent to 7 or 8 miles.
2. **Preparation - set an arbitrary but achievable goal. **
	Sign up for an arbitrary race and socialize it with friends. 
	We started a simple google spreadsheet to track our training progress. Simple and low-friction results in high adoption.
3. **Strategic flexibility on race day **
	Changing my race day strategy during the race.
	The first 2 miles were slow and easy. I had 3 strategies that I was actively toggling. It's worth mentioning that it was easy for me to do this because I've spent time with each one. This wasn’t the mental drain it sounds like it should be. I suppose that's where some experience comes in handy. My reasoning went something like this:
	Time-based (A)
	Maintain between 7:30-7:45 minutes/mile pace
	Distance-based (B)
	Run a negative split, \\
	Perceived exertion (feel-based)
	70% perceived exertion. Push it to 80% towards the end of the race when I know I'll have sufficient fuel. 
4. **Fire up the race day juices**!

At mile 2 I decided that since my longest run in the past 6 months was 11 miles I would have unpredictable energy towards the end of the race. So I decided to run by listening to my body. I also had a secondary rule that if I felt footsteps of someone closing on me I would push up to 90% to break their effort. This actually happened twice and I was surprised to notice that I was able to pull away in both cases. For example I was leading the pack around mile 5. It was single track for a couple of miles. I kept a strong pace. It felt amazing to be cruising along with a pack nipping at my heels. 

There are two components to great running: physical and the mental. It's important to understand one's abilities holistically to understand where best to spend effort. 

Physical:
immutable - (Vo2, strength, form, muscle fiber twitch composition, achilles length, etc...)
mutable - strength, muscle fiber, capillary density, 

Mental:
I'm more interested in the thoughts that people think when they run than in their running. When it gets hard how do you react? What's interesting to me is that while there are infinite thoughts runners think when they run. Geoff mentioned that his mind feels like a hampster wheel stuck on a thought. It's like a feedback loop of pointing a camera at a tv. 
It's probably more useful to consider the valence; are your thoughts of a positive or a negative type. That's level 1. An appropriate question g-d as surveyer might ask:
How do you feel your prospects for the future are? Basically: can I do this or can't I do this?
Great champions need to be delusional. I would assume that believing that you can be the best in the world requires that you have this belief before it's proven. For each champion that makes it happen there surely exist many more believers for whom this turns out to be false. Therefore a proportiontely small number of believers are correct. So believing ones self a champion ahead of the fact is akin to believing one will win the lottery. But without that belief the slim chance is all but obliterated. Kind of interesting.
