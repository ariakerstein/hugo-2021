I’ve noticed that I am sometimes different at work than in other areas of life. I’m not a stressed person when the stakes are high (see [chemolog.com]). Quite the opposite. I’m at peace with my maker. It’s people that I find most challenging. For example if I’m on a long walk up against darkness, rain and still need to get the tent up I’ll be the one leading the charge, making a plan and with a smile on my face. I used to sail quite a lot and learned that self reliance early. It’s more specific - it’s superiors in rank within a hierarchy that I specifically tend to be challenged by. I suspect this relates to power dynamics growing up but I don’t want to swim in the dark toward buoys that may not exist. 

What are the differences? 
* Loss of confidence resulting in apprehensive - (second guessing decisions)
* Caring what others think (optics)
* Trivialities will agitate disproportional to their importance (lack of confidence)
* Loss of enthusiasm and joy in the face of adversity (fear)
Why doesn’t this attitude carry fully into work? I find myself agitated over small things, caring what others think, and second guessing myself. It’s so unlike me. Or is it? 
I make the assumption that because it's someone else's company that I'm a visitor and others know more than I do. I get my power by knowledge. And when I only know about the proverbial Elephant's knee cap I'll assume that mine is a myopic viewpoint and that others can see the whole elephant (read: my decisions are limited in efficacy bccause I don't know enough). That's an unhelpful mindset. 

## Let’s pick apart the circumstantial diffs. 
### Self reliance vs. team orchestration
As a kid I would rely on my inner resources to a high degree. I did not focus on orchestrating the conditions to my advantage. Rather, my heros were solo adventurers and individual 
** shift to finding heroes that are leaders vs. solo geniuses **

###  Managing against the (perceived) judgment of hierarchical superiors. 
I fear the judgment of others more than my own. Consider Michael Jordan - he held impossibly high standards and would not compromise. Do the same.
** Hold myself to a higher standard than any manager would (to an inner scorecard)**
The benefit of the above is that the manager shifts to the role of a coach. Manager is a compass not a clock. 
This relates to confidence… 

### Confidence is relative
I am a highly confident person. Except when I perceive that those around me are better than I am (imposter syndrome). The key is know that nobody has the answers. Rest on the bedrock of your ability to figure it out vs. knowing the answers a-priori. Combine that with the ability to bring the team along and there you have a potent knowledge economy warrior. 
**So, consider your upper management a compass (a gut-check, not a judge)**

### Fear leads to injury
Gymnastics is one of the most injurious sports. Why? Apprehension. Imagine you’re about to execute a complex movement - flips and twists in mid-air. If you screw up you could break your neck. Two lessons: (1) Apprehension can only hurt you. If you’re going to commit to the move you must commit fully without hesitation. The place for apprehension is in the mental calculation to clear the bar. But once you clear that mental “willingness to try” bar the physical one must be swift; (2) Learn how to fall well without face-planting - you WILL screw up. 

I find the last one particularly compelling. If I decide to go for a run I’m all in. Half way is not worth doing.
