The frisbee veers into the brush. Lua and I walk over. As we crouch over the planter box I look down and notice green protruding jaws cupping two tablespoons of water. Inching closer I notice white spots, leopard patterns and tiny teeth protruding along the edges of the leaves.

I’m somewhat horrified, not by this frozen violence, but rather by my lack of awareness about plants. I love nature. I’ll take any opportunity to walk nestled in trees and organic forms. It makes me feel at home, at peace. But my nearly total disinterest in the specifics of botany (except for the few species I bothered to look up) leaves me dumbfounded. Is it possible I’ve lived among this plant life for decades, without asking or wondering about the specific details? To what other wonders has my daily haste blinded me?

How about light? I’ll nearly always forget the miracle of these far-traveling energy packets in favor of the current obsession.

How can I notice more of these moments? How can I bring that focus to the present moment like a collapsing of mind space into NOW. It’s fairly incredible to think about how spread around my mind is, mostly spread into the future/worry mind space. 

I think the answer is to get intensely present. 
We are temporal beings. We are keenly aware of music and beats and time. We are aware of the space between notes. We dance. But our perspective oscillates (perhaps not evenly) like a pendulum bobbing between past and future, spending little time actually at the present state. 
But sometimes, when the external pushes stop, the pendulum stills. It still has pendulum nature - it just takes a small kick to get it going again. But for a brief moment I exist here and now. With plants.
