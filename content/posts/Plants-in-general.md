The frisbee veers into the brush. Lua and I walk over. As we crouch over the planter box I look down and notice green protruding jaws cup two tablespoons of water. As I inch closer, I notice white spots, patterns and tiny teeth protruding along the edges of the leaves.

I’m somewhat horrified, not by this frozen violence, but rather by my lack of awareness about plants. I love nature. I’ll take any opportunity to walk nestled in trees and organic forms. It makes me feel at home, at peace. But my near total disinterest in the specifics of botany leaves me dumbfounded. How is it possible I’ve lived among this plants for decades with such blatent disregard for the details? To what other wonders has my daily haste blinded me?

How can I notice more of these moments? 

The answer is to get present. Our perspective oscillates like a pendulum's swing: past-future, future-past, blurring past *this* moment. But sometimes, when the outside energy dissipates, the pendulum stills. It still has pendulum nature - it'll only take a small kick to get it going again. But for a brief moment it is not in motion. 

So it is. I exist here and now. With plants.
