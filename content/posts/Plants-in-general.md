# Plants, in general

The frisbee veers into the brush. Lua and I walk over. As we crouch over the planter box I look down and notice green protruding jaws cupping two tablespoons of water. Inching closer I notice white spots, leopard patterns and tiny teeth protruding along the edges of the leaves. 
I’m somewhat horrified, not by this frozen violence, but rather by my lack of awareness about plants. I love nature. I’ll take any opportunity to walk nestled in trees and organic forms. It makes me feel at home, at peace. But my nearly total disinterest in the specifics of botany (except for a few select species) leaves me dumbfounded. Is it possible I’ve lived among this plant life for decades, without asking or wondering about the specific details? To what other wonders has my daily haste blinded me?
How about light? I’ll walk down the street stuck in my thoughts, forgetting the miracle of these far-traveling energy packets. And shadows - I barely notice them unless I’m looking. 
How can I notice more of these moments? Get present. How can I being that focus to the present moment like a collapsing of mind space into NOW. It’s fairly incredible to think about how spread around my mind is, mostly spread into the future/worry mind space. 
Time. We are temporal beings. We are keenly aware of music and beats and time. We are aware of the space between notes. We dance.  And we shift our perspectives away from the present moment. It’s like a weird seesaw whereby the consciousness is pulled between the forces of past and future. It seems elusive but it is wonderful to find the moment when the balance point is just right and I exist here/now. Plants!
