The frisbee veers into the brush. Lua and I walk over. As we crouch over the planter box I look down and notice green protruding jaws cup two tablespoons of water. As I inch closer, I notice white spots, patterns and tiny teeth protruding along the edges of the leaves.

I’m somewhat horrified, not by this frozen violence, but rather by my lack of awareness about plants. I love nature. I’ll take any opportunity to walk nestled in trees and organic forms. It makes me feel at home, at peace. But my near total disinterest in the specifics of botany leaves me dumbfounded. How is it possible I’ve lived among this plants for decades with such blatent disregard for the details? To what other wonders has my daily haste blinded me?

How can I notice more of these moments? 

The answer is to get present. Our perspective oscillates like a pendulum's swing: past-future, future-past, always whizzing past *now*. But sometimes the outside energy dissipates and the pendulum stills. 

If the first step is to stop the motion, the second step is to get calm in the stillness. Step 2 is much harder. I’ve come to think that remaining calm while sitting still is one of the hardest things to do. 

Still is not the same as calm. When still, the question I find most helpful to ask myself is: what else is here? In the same way that a drop of water seems still, our stillness vibrates with Brownian motions of mind. 

So it is. I exist here and now. With plants.
