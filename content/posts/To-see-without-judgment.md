# To see without judgment

I engage with the present moment - in this case, staring at my daughters face. And there's no background noise, just peace. I'm free to be here, now. This state is easily described, hard to attain, nearly impossible to live without constant reminding. I wrote this post as a trigger, a reminder to myself, that this is possible. To be here now. 
It’s like needing to remind myself to breathe. Life can be asphyxiating and we need to take VERY deep breaths. For me this is the recharge. Be present. If I had one wish for my future self I think this would be it. Be. Here. Now. It’s the greatest place on earth.
