description: "Sundays drives are the best"

Sunday is the start of the week. It's a day of new
beginnings. This is when I do my weekly planning. And it's a time I do
some evaluation of the previous week. I like doing it this way. It's
the difference between building a life like a rocket-ship vs. a
car. The car has close feedback between the driver and
road/conditions. In contrast the rocket must be planned perfectly at
the outset. I drive. 

## Why not monday? 
Monday? Monday is when the rubber hits the road. I always have hated
Monday. You might think that a well-laid plan for the week would make
Monday awesome. So why not? Not sure but my aim is to connect Sunday
awesomeness so it bleeds into Monday. Let's see if I can come back
with a better answer. More to come....
