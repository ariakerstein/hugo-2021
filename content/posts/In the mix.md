Anxiety is increased when I’m outside the mix. When I jump into the churning pot of mess I’m really happy. That’s because I’m focused on the problem and struggles at hand.

There’s a very clear delineation in my mind. Am I focused on the judgments of others or the problem. Am I focused on hitting the ball, or on the pitcher’s intention (to strike me out!)? 

Imagine the martian - if he didn’t immerse in the problems in front of him he would certainly have gone mad. Or Ernest Shackleton enabling this for his men. In both cases the work set them free. Intense focus on the work and the task and not on the people around it. They are just enablers.
