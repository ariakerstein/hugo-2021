A Bioinformatics Study & ReportA paper I wrote for a bioinformatics class several years ago in which I annotated part of the Drosophila Erecta genome (Fosmid 14) as part of a concerted effort to annotate the entire genome. The study was spearheaded by Washington U. in Seattle. This paper was A Bioinformatics Study & Report written for a class I took at SFSU in 2007.
