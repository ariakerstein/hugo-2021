Mastery over ego

Internal interest and direction came from somewhere. If you trace it back ask youself if this came from others or from your\
self.

Power is a barrier. When you have a manager, a team, it’s easy for a switch to happen. In my own career I’ve seen the worst\
 in my emerge when I switch from a mastery mindset to an ego mindset. I start worrying about optics, shielding, upward comm\
unication. This is what’s called taking your eye off the ball. And it’s been a personal barrier to doing the work.

Michael Jordan said it's about the fans. The tactics he used to get inside other players heads was in service of greatness \
and mastery. Jeff Bezos says it’s about customers.

The problem is when customers are secondary - abstract or distant. Then the company perimeter/arena dominates.

How can we return to a mastery mindset amidst pressures of reviews and the practical prssures of corporate life?

The inner game of tennis talks about challenge as a mechanic for understanding.
