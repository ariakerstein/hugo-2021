      <description>We often think of quality as embedded within a product. Does the product have the capabilities and craftsmanship I would expect? Is it well built? Does it function well? Those all matter, of course. But quality is as much in the building as it is in the product itself; quality before quality.
I kind of knew this for a long time but have often disregarded this idea in my push to ship and iterate.</description>
