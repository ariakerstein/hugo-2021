      <description>I’ve noticed that I am sometimes different at work than in other areas of life. I’m not a stressed person when the stakes are high (see [chemolog.com]). Quite the opposite. I’m at peace with my maker. It’s people that I find most challenging. For example if I’m on a long walk up against darkness, rain and still need to get the tent up I’ll be the one leading the charge, making a plan and with a smile on my face.</description>

      <title>When to show your work</title>

      <description>Holding onto work too long leads to stagnation, like part of a river branch flowing into a dead end swamp. A good outcome for showing work is either some fundamental flaw is exposed or tweaks suggested to optimize it. Either way time (the only non-renewable resource) is preserved. Through a quick personal survey I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that my outcomes tend to be good the majority of the time when I show my work quickly.</description>
